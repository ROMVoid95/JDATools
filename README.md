## JDATools
JDATools is a fork of [JDATools](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) which is a series of tools and utilities for use with [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) to assist in bot creation.

## Packages
Unlike JDA-Utilities, JDATools has combined the seperate packages and removed the Examples package in favor a monolithic library spec
